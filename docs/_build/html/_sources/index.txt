Introduction
=====================

---------------------
Beyond PYNQ
---------------------

1) PYNQ project integrated Linux operating system over Processing System(PS), MicroBlaze micro controller for real time control, and fast computation over FPGA fabric (PL)
2) PYNQ does not provide Arduino integration as software, therefore, Arduino firmware needs to be converted to fit on MicroBlaze
3) PYNQ enables users to develop with Python and Jupyter notebook ,however, it is still challenge for non-programmers to customize the python code

---------------------
Project objective
---------------------
Pynquino projects aims to provide following softwares for reinforcing Arduino integration with PYNQ and easy development for non-programmer.

1) Pynquino compiler for porting Arduino code to PYNQ-Microblaze automatically
2) Blockly editor as wrapper environment of Jupyter notebook 

---------------------
Application
---------------------
1) Integrate different types of robot and sensors 
2) Accelerate computer vision and machine learning
